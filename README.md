📖 About The Project
This project is a detailed front-end replica of the Amazon website. It was built from the ground up to practice and showcase fundamental web development skills without relying on any front-end frameworks. The main goal was to create a dynamic, interactive, and fully responsive user interface that mirrors the core functionalities of a real-world e-commerce site.

✨ Key Features
🛍️ Dynamic Product Grid: Products are rendered dynamically onto the homepage from a JavaScript data module.

🛒 Interactive Shopping Cart: Users can add products to the cart, and the cart quantity in the header updates instantly.

📄 Detailed Checkout Page: A comprehensive summary of the order, where users can view items, update quantities, and delete products from their cart.

📱 Fully Responsive Design: The layout seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to widescreen desktops, using modern CSS techniques.

📦 Modular Codebase: JavaScript is organized into ES6 modules for better maintainability and separation of concerns.

📸 Sneak Peek
